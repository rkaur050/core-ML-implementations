# Linear Regression Implementation

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict a target variable from a single feature. The implementation includes functions for computing model predictions, calculating the cost function, and performing gradient descent to optimize the model parameters.

## Features

- Linear regression for a single feature and a target.
- Cost function (Mean Squared Error) computation.
- Gradient descent algorithm for optimizing model parameters.
- Customizable learning rate and number of iterations.
- Visualization of the fitted line.
