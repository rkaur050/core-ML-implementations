# Perceptron-Classifier

## Description
This repository contains a simple implementation of a perceptron algorithm for binary classification of linearly separable data. The perceptron is trained using basic examples like the AND gate, demonstrating how the perceptron adjusts weights and bias to classify data points.

## Features
- Train a perceptron model on linearly separable data.
- Visualize original data points and model predictions.
- Display the decision boundary learned by the perceptron.
