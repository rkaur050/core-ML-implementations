# Decision Tree Classifier with Post-Pruning

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a Decision Tree Classifier applied to the famous Iris dataset using Scikit-learn. In addition to training the classifier, the project highlights the concept of **post-pruning** to optimize the decision tree and improve generalization by avoiding overfitting.
