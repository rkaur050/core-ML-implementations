# Decision Tree Classifier with Post-Pruning

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a Decision Tree Classifier applied to the famous Iris dataset using Scikit-learn. In addition to training the classifier, the project highlights the concept of **post-pruning** to optimize the decision tree and improve generalization by avoiding overfitting.
The main goal is to simplify the decision tree by removing parts of the tree that do not provide significant power in classifying data, thereby preventing overfitting.
