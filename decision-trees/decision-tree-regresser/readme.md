# Decision Tree Regressor Project

## Overview

This project implements a **Decision Tree Regressor** using scikit-learn. The Decision Tree Regressor is used to predict continuous target variables based on a dataset. Decision Trees are powerful machine learning algorithms used for both regression and classification tasks. They work by recursively splitting data into subsets based on feature values, building a model in a tree-like structure.

In this project, we apply the Decision Tree Regressor to predict target values using a housing dataset.

## Features

- Train a Decision Tree Regressor using the provided dataset.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
- Evaluation of  the model using metrics.
