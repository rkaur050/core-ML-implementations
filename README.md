# core-ML-implementations
Implementing core machine learning algorithms from the ground up, focusing on the mathematical foundations.

## Introduction

This repository focuses on building machine learning models from scratch where possible, using fundamental mathematical concepts. However, in cases where building from scratch is complex or inefficient, **scikit-learn** is used to help demonstrate practical implementations and for comparison purposes.

The goal is to provide a balance between learning how the algorithms work internally and applying them efficiently using well-known libraries like **scikit-learn**.
